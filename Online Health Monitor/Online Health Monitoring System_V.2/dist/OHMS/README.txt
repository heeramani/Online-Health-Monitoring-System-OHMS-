## Introduction

Online health monitoring or Online patient monitoring system (OHMS) is a promising technology to
enable patient monitoring outside the conventional clinical system, i.e., the patient can be monitored
remotely


##Requirements
* You should have Netbeans installed along with java 8 in Windows OS.
* You should open this software in Java netbeans and test various test case given below.

##Version:
* This is Version 1.0;
* Other version when realesed notified and updated automatically.

## Built With
* This software project is developed using Java Netbeans. So you have to installed Java 8 on System. This is developed on Windows OS 10.
This software is developed using csv file system as storage(file handling). For that jar function of csv is used.
* For JFrame Calender, JDate Chooser is used as calender. For that also, jar file used.

## Running the tests
* Build project is saved in C:\Users\Heeramani\Documents\NetBeansProjects\OHMS;
* Various test case mentioned in TestCase.xlsx.
* User can go there,open file and check test cases.
* All running test cases saved in user.csv file in OHMS main project folder.

## Break down into end to end tests

* All test cases with proper explantion , expected output, actual output, and their status or comment is given there.

##Known Issues

*If you discover any bugs, feel free to Heeramani Prasad(email: heeramani.15342@gmail.com).

## Acknowledgments

* This project is made with help of seaching various error error on google -> Stackflow (generally) and youtube. Also contribution of friends and TA's and professor cannot be neglected.

## Inspiration:
While designing one of use case, i was unable to design proper input and output. So, this inspired me a lot and i developed this software within 2 days.
